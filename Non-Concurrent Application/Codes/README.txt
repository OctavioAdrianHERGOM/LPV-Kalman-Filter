PLEASE, CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING: 
THE CODE IS NOT CLEAN, AS: 
 - MANY REQUIRED LMIS WERE MANUALLY DECLARED AND INITIALIZED.

 - SEVERAL COMMENTS ARE STILL INCLUDED TO GUIDE AND ORIENT THE AUTHOR DURING DEVELOPMENT.

 - THE CODE USES INTRINSIC FLUID (WATER) AND PIPELINE PARAMETERS, WHICH CAN BE COMPUTED AS SHOWN IN: 

   EXACT-DIFFERENTIATION-BASED LEAK DETECTION AND ISOLATION IN A PLASTIC PIPELINE UNDER TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS

PLOTTING

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED OFFLINE, AND THE METHODOLOGY IS THE SAME AS PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD LEAK

A POSSIBLE WAY TO IMPLEMENT IT ONLINE COULD BE TO, SOME TIME AFTER THE ESTIMATION, SOLVE THE LMIs FOR THE SECOND LEAK.
CONSIDERING A LEAK WITH FLOW BETWEEN 2% AND 5% OF THE NOMINAL FLOW, IN ORDER TO COMPUTE THE VERTEX SYSTEMS.

WHEN THE SECOND LEAK TRIGGERS THE SECOND ALARM AND THEREFORE THE SECOND OBSERVER, 
THE LEAK PARAMETERS OF THE CORRESPONDING LEAK CAN THEN BE ESTIMATED.
